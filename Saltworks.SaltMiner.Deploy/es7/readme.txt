To install ES 7 instead of 8, copy the files in this directory back out to the 
main directory, overwriting the versions there (you can back them up first of course).

There's more to be done now, as the install script has moved on from where it was for 7.x.

NOTE: Kibana theme not tested or compatible with ES7 as of this writing.
